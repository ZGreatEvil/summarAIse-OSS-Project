# summarAIse

AI-powered lecture notes summariser. Fully local, no internet required, no paid API.

Upload your notes (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, and more), get a faithful summary and
exportable Anki flashcards, all running on your own machine.

summarAIse is a single-pass summariser: it makes one model call over the
whole document. It comes with a model picker, a simple Streamlit interface, and
flashcard export, which keeps it easy to run and well suited to short and
medium-length notes.

## What you need

| Requirement | Minimum | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| OS | Windows 10, macOS 14 Sonoma, Linux | |
| RAM | 8 GB | 16 GB recommended for 7–8B models or large docs |
| Storage | ~5 GB free | For the Ollama model |
| Python | 3.12 | 3.10 is the hard floor, do not use 3.14+ |
| GPU | Not required | Speeds up inference if available |

---

## Environment

This project was developed and tested using:

- **Visual Studio Code** (recommended editor)
- **Python 3.12** (3.10 minimum, 3.13 maximum)
- **Git** and **GitHub** for version control

---

## 1. Install Ollama

Ollama runs the local AI model. Install it **once**, outside of Python.

### macOS

```sh
# Option A, Homebrew (recommended: runs as a background service)
brew install ollama
brew services start ollama

# Option B, native app (menu bar icon, auto-starts on login)
# Download Ollama.dmg from https://ollama.com/download/mac
```

### Windows

Open **PowerShell** and run:

```powershell
irm https://ollama.com/install.ps1 | iex
```

Or download the installer directly from [ollama.com/download/windows](https://ollama.com/download/windows).

After installation, Ollama runs as a background service automatically.

### Linux

```sh
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

---

## 2. Pull a model

You only need **one** model. Pick based on your notes:

```sh
# Recommended (vision): reads equations, diagrams, and images in slides/pages
ollama pull qwen2.5vl:3b   # 3.2 GB

# Or text-only: lighter, but image-only content (figures, hand-drawn equations) is skipped
ollama pull qwen2.5:3b     # 1.9 GB
```

The app shows a **model picker** listing every model you have installed. The single
model you select does both the extraction and the summary. A vision model is
recommended for slide decks and scanned PDFs. The default selection is `qwen2.5vl:3b`
(set as `DEFAULT_MODEL` in `summaraise/config.py`), but any installed model works,
and you can pull a larger one (e.g. `llava:7b`) if you have the RAM.

---

## 3. Install Python 3.12

Skip this step if you already have Python 3.12 installed (`python --version`).

### macOS (pyenv)

```sh
# Install pyenv if you don't have it
brew install pyenv

# Install Python 3.12 and pin it to this project
pyenv install 3.12.10
pyenv local 3.12.10        # creates .python-version in the project folder
```

### Windows

Download the **Python 3.12** installer from
[python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and run it.

> During setup, tick **"Add Python to PATH"** before clicking Install.

Verify in a new terminal:

```powershell
python --version   # should print Python 3.12.x
```

### Linux

```sh
# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3.12 python3.12-venv

# Or via pyenv (all distros)
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
pyenv install 3.12.10
pyenv local 3.12.10
```

---

## 4. Create the virtual environment

Run these commands from inside the project folder.

### macOS / Linux

```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`

---

## 5. Verify the setup

```sh
python scripts/setup_check.py
```

Expected output:

```
summarAIse: setup check

  ✓  Ollama server is running
  ✓  At least one Ollama model is installed

  Installed models: qwen2.5:3b, qwen2.5vl:3b

All checks passed. Run the app with:
  streamlit run app.py
```

---

## 6. Run the app

```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

Open [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) in your browser.

## Supported file formats

| Format | Extension(s) |
|---|---|
| PDF | `.pdf` |
| Word | `.docx` |
| PowerPoint | `.pptx` |
| Excel | `.xlsx`, `.xls` |

## System requirements (detailed)

| Library | Version | Python floor | Python ceiling |
|---|---|---|---|
| Streamlit | 1.58.0 | 3.10 | 3.14 |
| MarkItDown | 0.1.6 | 3.10 | 3.13 |
| ollama (client) | 0.6.2 | 3.8 | - |
| genanki | 0.13.1 | 3.6 | - |

The combined floor is **Python 3.10**. The combined ceiling is **Python 3.13**.
Python 3.12 is the recommended version.

---

## Troubleshooting

**`zsh: command not found: ollama` / `ollama is not recognized`**
Ollama is not installed or not on your PATH. Repeat step 1.

**`No Ollama models installed` error in the app**
Pull at least one model, e.g. `ollama pull qwen2.5vl:3b`, then refresh the page.

**Scanned / image-only PDFs produce no text**
Use a vision-capable model (e.g. `qwen2.5vl:3b`). The app automatically rasterises
pages that have no readable text and sends them to the vision model for description.

**Slow summarisation**
This is normal on CPU-only machines. The 3B model is the fastest option.
Streaming output means you see results progressively rather than waiting for the
full response.
